# Exercise 01: Setting up an Excel Data Source in Power BI

## Introduction
In this exercise, I set up a Microsoft Excel data source for Power BI, connecting to an Excel file, selecting and importing data, and creating a basic report.  
The goal is to put into practice the skills of connecting to flat files, ensuring data quality, and building an initial visualization.

## Case Study
Jamie, an Adventure Works executive, requested a report for the Sales department, showing details for each required order — including:
- Product
- Unit Price
- Order Quantity
- Discount Rate  

The report will be used during the annual review meeting.  
Each country manager provided a Microsoft Excel workbook containing the relevant data. My task was to connect to all of them and combine them into a single Power BI report.

## Resources
- **Software:** Power BI Desktop
- **Data:** Excel flat file (no pivot tables, totals, or mixed data types)
- **Files in this folder:**
  - `Exercise_Setting up an Excel data source.csv` – raw data
  - `Sales_Report.pbix` – Power BI project file
  - `dashboard_screenshot.png` – final dashboard view

## Steps Taken
### Step 1: Prepare the File
- Saved the Excel file locally (or via OneDrive/SharePoint).
- Ensured the dataset followed these rules:
  - No total rows/columns
  - Each column contains a single data type
  - Table format (no pivot/matrix)
  - Table name without spaces

### Step 2: Connect to the Data in Power BI
1. Opened Power BI Desktop.
2. Selected **Get Data → Excel**.
3. Navigated to the file location and selected the relevant worksheet.
4. Imported the table via the Navigator window.
5. Loaded the data into Power BI.

### Step 3: Explore and Save
- Checked the imported data in **Data View**.
- Saved the Power BI project file.

## Output
- **PBIX File:** Contains the connected and cleaned dataset, ready for analysis.
- **Dashboard Screenshot:** Shows the final view of the report created in Power BI.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Connecting Excel as a data source
- Data quality checks and formatting
- Power BI data loading
- Basic visualization setup
